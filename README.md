<h1>Phishing Analysis</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Social Engineering and Phishing is among the top methods for attackers to gain entry into a system or network. It is important to be capable of identifying a phishing email apart from non-malicious email. There are many different types of phishing emails that exist, and not all are equally harmful. Below we will discus more in depth the types of phishing emails, and how to investigate them and confirm whether they are malicious in nature.

<h3>Information</h3>

Phishing attacks can come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and varying degrees of danger when interacting with each type. Here are some of the different types of phishing attacks:

- <b>Recon</b>
- <b>Credential Harvester</b>
- <b>Social Engineering</b>
- <b>Vishing/Smishing</b>
- <b>Whaling</b>
- <b>Malicious File attachment</b>
- <b>Spam</b>

**Recon**: Spam emails that aim to confirm whether the email address is valid and in use. May be simple and just contain a string of random letters, or could include some elements of social engineering techniques to elicit a response from the recipient. Can include tracking pixels to see if the email has been viewed in an email client.

**Credential Harvester**: One of the more common types of phishing emails that utilizes impersonation in attempt to retrieve the recipients credentials. The impersonation attempt includes copying the impersonated company's branding fonts, images, etc. Typically there will be errors in the impersonation attempt and will seem slightly off when looking at it. Although with A.I. being used in more areas of Cybersecurity, credential harvester emails have gotten more and more realistic and hard to tell the original from the impersonator. The best way to avoid falling for a credential harvester is to seperately go to the companies website you might be getting an email from and signing in from the official page instead of using any links within the email.

**Social Engineering**: Used in most other applications of phishing attacks. It's the practice of exploiting a human, using psychological methods in order to get them to do things they wouldn't normally do, like disclosing confidential information or transferring money to an unverified account, etc. The techniques or principles they take advantage of are authority, intimidation, consensus, scarcity, urgency, and familiarity. For example, they could use the authority tactic and impersonate a your boss or a higher authority and utilize that authority to make you say "oh if its coming from the boss, then it must be important, I guess I'll just do what they are asking".

**Vishing/Smishing**: Vishing is a phishing attack that utilizes voice messaging (phonecall/voicemail). Smishing is a phishing attack that utilizes SMS (text messages). 

**Whaling**: Whaling is a phishing attack that is specifically targeting someone that is of higher authority or in a management position. This is because this person would likely have extended authorization on confidential information.

**Malicious File Attachment**: Phishing emails can often contain malicious links in the form of an attachment or a hyperlink within the body of the message. Since most email providers will prohibit the sending of files with certain attachements, attackers get creative and use a different tactic like sending microsoft office files with that are triggered when you "enable content". The malicious code is embedded in the microsoft macros which call out to a domain and downloads malware to the system. Hyperlinks are vector a in which an attacker could gain access to your system, as malware is hosted on a website that you visited via the hyperlink. 

**Spam**: Junk mail that are unsolicited, unwanted, or unexepected but not necessarily malicious. It can be a newsletter that you unknowingly signed up for, or marketnig emails trying to promote a product or service.
